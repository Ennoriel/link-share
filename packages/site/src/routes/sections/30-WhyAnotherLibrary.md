## Why another library to display sharing ~~buttons~~ links?

There are already countless ones:

- vanilla JS components:
  - [sharingbuttons.io](https://github.com/mxstbr/sharingbuttons.io)
  - [sharer.js](https://github.com/ellisonleao/sharer.js)
- react components:
  - [next-share](https://github.com/Bunlong/next-share)
  - [react-share](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share)
- svelte components:
  - [sveltekit-share-buttons](https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-share-buttons)
  - [svelte-share-buttons-component](https://github.com/pchynoweth/svelte-share-buttons-component)

What they lack:

- they are all button based while a link element (`<a href="">`) is enough
- they are not all well maintained
- they are all for only one framework
